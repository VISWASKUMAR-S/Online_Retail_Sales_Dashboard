## Overview

This project focuses on **Tata's Online Retail Store** and aims to provide insights through data visualization. Using Power BI, I've crafted an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore key metrics, trends, and patterns related to sales, revenues, and other relevant aspects.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration and Transformation**: The dataset has undergone measures like data cleaning and transformation. We've used various charts to gain a basic understanding of the top 10 revenue-generating products and sales across different countries. Date filters are also available for deeper analysis.

2. **Forecasting Product Trends**: By leveraging the dashboard, we strategically forecast product trends. This contributes to the sustained growth of Tata's online retail business.
